# Problem:-

### We have a company's dataset from a survey conducted for the employees. We have to do the analysis and figure out why the employees are leaving the company.


# 🧑‍💼 Employee Turnover Analysis

This beginner-friendly project analyzes factors affecting employee turnover using HR analytics data.  
The goal is to uncover patterns related to workload, performance, and retention that can help improve HR decisions.

## ✅ Key Findings

- **Balanced Workload:** Employees with 3–4 projects and average working hours between 150–250 are less likely to leave.
- **Overwork/Underwork Risk:** Both very high and very low working hours correlate with higher turnover.
- **Satisfaction Matters:** Low satisfaction scores are linked with increased turnover.
- **Performance Influence:** Employees with moderate evaluation scores tend to stay longer.
- **Turnover Patterns:** Workload and satisfaction are stronger indicators of turnover than evaluation scores alone.
